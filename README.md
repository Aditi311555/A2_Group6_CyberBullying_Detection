# Multi-Modal Cyberbullying Detection System

## Project Objective

This project aims to build a comprehensive **multi-modal cyberbullying detection system**, designed to detect harmful or offensive content from a variety of input formats:

*  **Text messages**
* **Emoji usage patterns**
*  **Audio messages** (via Speech-to-Text)
* **Marathi message detection** (via Marathi → English translation)
*  **Encrypted or obfuscated text detection** (e.g., `f**k`, `f*k`)
*  **Image-based text detection** (via OCR extraction)

The system is built to be **real-time, scalable, and practical for modern social media platforms**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Details

* **Total Rows:** 18,000
* **Features:**

  * `comment`: Text message (English + Hinglish)
  * `is_bullying`: Binary label

    * `0 = Not Bullying`
    * `1 = Bullying`

Dataset includes real-world, noisy, multilingual, and code-mixed text to improve model robustness.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

We trained and compared the following algorithms:

* `DecisionTreeClassifier`
* `BaggingClassifier`
* `LinearSVC` ← **Final model**
* `LogisticRegression`
* `SGDClassifier`
* `MultinomialNB`
* `AdaBoostClassifier`

---

##  Multi-Modal Pipeline Components

###  Speech-to-Text

* Converts audio messages to text
* Text sent to classifier for bullying detection

###  Marathi → English Translation

* Supports Marathi bullying detection
* Marathi input → translated to English → classified
* If result is benign, output is shown in Marathi

###  OCR for Image-Based Text

* Extracts text from images using OCR
* Text is classified and flagged if abusive

###  SymSpell Spell Correction

* Corrects typos, noisy inputs, obfuscated text
* Improves accuracy for user-generated content

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a **multi-modal cyberbullying detection pipeline** that effectively integrates:

* Text-based NLP
* Audio message interpretation
* Image-to-text extraction
* Emoji analysis
* Multilingual support
* Encrypted text normalization

By combining several modalities and preprocessing strategies (spell correction, OCR, translation), the system overcomes weaknesses of traditional text-only models and provides reliable, real-time moderation for social media platforms.

The system also includes support for **blocking repeated offenders**, demonstrating practical intervention potential.

Multilingual support across **English, Hindi, Marathi**, combined with detection from **encrypted / obfuscated text**, maximizes real-world applicability.
